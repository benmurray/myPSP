# myPSP
A take on the Personal Software Process as described by Watts S. Humphrey

myPSP is a online system designed for software engineers to imporve themseleves.  

## Goals
* To be an online repository of past, current, and planned work
* To be a resource used to improve the quality of work of the software engineer
* To reveal areas of the the personal software process that need improvement

## Background

### Introduction
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_software_process): The Personal Software Process (PSP) is a structured software development process that is intended to help software engineers better understand and improve their performance by tracking their predicted and actual development of code. 

### Objectives
The PSP aims to provide software engineers with disciplined methods for improving personal software development processes. The PSP helps software engineers to:

 * Improve their estimating and planning skills.
 * Make commitments they can keep.
 * Manage the quality of their projects.
 * Reduce the number of defects in their work.
 
### The Importance of Data
One of the core aspects of the PSP is using historical data to analyze and improve process performance. PSP data collection is supported by four main elements:

* Scripts
* Measures
* Standards
* Forms
