Humphrey\r\n\r\nmyPSP is a online system designed for software engineers to imporve themseleves.  \r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n* To be an online repository of past, current, and planned work\r\n* To be a resource used to improve the quality of work of the software engineer\r\n* To reveal areas of the the personal software process that need improvement\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nFrom [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_software_process): The Personal Software Process (PSP) is a structured software development process that is intended to help software engineers better understand and improve their performance by tracking their predicted and actual development of code. \r\n\r\n### Objectives\r\nThe PSP aims to provide software engineers with disciplined methods for improving personal software development processes. The PSP helps software engineers to:\r\n\r\n * Improve their estimating and planning skills.\r\n * Make commitments they can keep.\r\n * Manage the quality of their projects.\r\n * Reduce the number of defects in their work.\r\n \r\n### The Importance of Data\r\nOne of the core aspects of the PSP is using historical data to analyze and improve process performance. PSP data collection is supported by four main elements:\r\n\r\n* Scripts\r\n* Measures\r\n* Standards\r\n* Forms\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
